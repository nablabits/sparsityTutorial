    "Unlike many other fields of science, astrophysics relies almost entirely of observations of extremely distant objects. Large telescopes and long exposure times are required in order to capture enough photos to study these objects. This leads to various sources of distortion and noise in the obeserved images coming from: the Earth's atmosphere, the optical system used, the electronics of the detector and the random arrival of photons.\n",
