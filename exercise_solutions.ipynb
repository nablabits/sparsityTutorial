    "# Solutions to Exercises\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some example solutions to the exercises in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sparsity\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to simply convert both the true and noisy signals into Fourier space.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Define the sparse representations of the signals.\n",
    "x_sparse = fft(x)\n",
    "y_sparse = fft(y)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise can be estimated using `sigma_mad` using the sparse representation `y_sparse`. Then multiply by a $k$ factor of 3 or 4.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Determine the value of lambda.\n",
    "lamdba_val = 3 * sigma_mad(y_sparse) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `y_sparse` should be thresholded using `hard_thresh` as we aim to preserve the amplitude of the signal coefficients. The last trick is to remember to convert back to the direct space using the inverse Fourier transform `ifft`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Perform thresholding.\n",
    "x_rec = ifft(hard_thresh(y_sparse, lamda_val))\n",

    "\n",
    "Below is an example of the type of function you could have written. The import steps to remember were:\n",
    "\n",
    "- to estimate the noise standard deviation (*e.g.* using `noise_est`),\n",
    "- to scale $\\sigma$ for each of the wavelet scales using `sigma_sclaes`,\n",
    "- to assign $k$ values to get weights,\n",
    "- to decompose the noisy image,\n",
    "- to threshold only the wavelet scales of the decomposition using `thresh`,\n",
    "- to recombine the denoised decomposition, remembering to include the coarse scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Write your own one denoising function here\n",
    "def denoise(data, n_scales=4):\n",
    "\n",
    "    sigma_est_scales = sigma_scales(noise_est(data), n_scales)\n",
    "    weights = np.array([4] + [3] * sigma_est_scales[:-1].size) * sigma_est_scales\n",
    "    data_decomp = decompose(data, n_scales)\n",
    "    data_thresh = np.vstack([thresh(data_decomp[:-1].T, weights).T, \n",
    "                             data_decomp[-1, None]])\n",
    "\n",
    "    return recombine(data_thresh)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we need to remember to use the `getdata` method from Astropy to obtain the image of Saturn.\n",

    "# Load the image of Saturn\n",
    "saturn_noisy = getdata('./data/saturn_noisy.fits')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we just need to use our denoising function.\n",
